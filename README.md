### Hi there! 👋

#### 🌈 About me

🎓 I am an Engineering Physics Master's finalist at FCUP and FEUP, where I acquired knowledge of mathematics ➗, physics 🌌 and programming ⌨️, a passion that I discovered during the course. 

📈 I'm interested in data science and machine learning, and I'm looking for opportunities that would allow me to explore these areas.

I love to travel ✈️, read 📚 and learning, from languages 🗨️ to design and web development!
